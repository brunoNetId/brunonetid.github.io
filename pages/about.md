Thanks for visiting my blog site.

To introduce myself, I started working with distributed systems (precisely) in 2000, with the change of millennia (was that a sign? am I the one? I might have watched too many movies!). Back then, I was already experimenting and using sophisticated (at the time) integration frameworks and tools.

Over the years, I've worked in various industries, including the telco space, where I have been building large integration platforms for over ten hectic years.

Now I'm working as a *Technical Marketing Manager* at *Red Hat*, focused on our integration and messaging products. This space allows me to share my professional experience with others, and hopefully, readers will find its contents helpful in one way or another.
